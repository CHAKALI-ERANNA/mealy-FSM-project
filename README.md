# mealy-FSM-project
A sequential circuit has two inputs and two outputs. The inputs (X1X2) represent a 2 â€“ bit binary  number, N.if the present value of the N is greater than the previous value , then Z1= 1.  If the present value of the N if less than the previous value then Z2 = 1. Otherwise Z1 Z2 = 00. Design a  mealy FSM and write Verilog code and implement.
